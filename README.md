# ScriptingLanguages_Classwork

The term "scripting language" is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose interpreted languages, such as Perl,PowerShell, Python, and Tcl.

With the term "script" often used for small programs (up to a few thousand lines of code) in such languages, or in domain-specific languages such as the text-processing languages sed and AWK. Some of these languages were originally developed for use within a particular environment, and later developed into portable domain-specific or general-purpose languages. Conversely, many general-purpose languages have dialects that are used as scripting languages.
